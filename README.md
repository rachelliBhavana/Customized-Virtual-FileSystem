# About Virtual File System 
- In this project we emulate almost all the data structures which are used by operating system to 
manage File system oriented tasks.

- As the name suggest its virtual because we maintain all records in Primary storage. 

- In this project we create almost all the data structures which required for File Subsystems as 
  Inode Table, File Table, User File Descriptor Table, Super block, Disk 
  Data Block etc.
  
- We have provided all implementations of necessary system calls and commands of File 
  subsystem as Open, Close, Read, Write, Lseek, Create, RM, LS, Stat, Fstat etc. 
  
- While providing the implementations of all above functionality we use our own data 
structures. 

- By using this project we can get overview of UFS (UNIX File System) on any platform.
